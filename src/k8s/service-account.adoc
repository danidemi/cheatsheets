# Service Accounts

A service account is a type of non-human account that, in Kubernetes, provides a distinct identity in a Kubernetes cluster.

Service accounts exist as ServiceAccount objects in the API server

* Namespaced: Every namespace gets a default ServiceAccount upon creation.
* Lightweight
* Portable

Service accounts are different from user accounts, which are authenticated human users in the cluster. By default, user accounts don't exist in the Kubernetes API server

If you deploy a Pod in a namespace, and you don't manually assign a ServiceAccount to the Pod, Kubernetes assigns the default ServiceAccount for that namespace to the Pod.

# Use cases for Kubernetes service accounts



* Your Pods need to communicate with the Kubernetes API server, for example in situations such as the following:

    * Providing read-only access to sensitive information stored in Secrets.

    * Granting cross-namespace access, such as allowing a Pod in namespace example to read, list, and watch for Lease objects in the kube-node-lease namespace.

* Your Pods need to communicate with an external service. For example, a workload Pod requires an identity for a commercially available cloud API, and the commercial provider allows configuring a suitable trust relationship.

* Authenticating to a private image registry using an imagePullSecret.

* An external service needs to communicate with the Kubernetes API server. For example, authenticating to the cluster as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

* You use third-party security software in your cluster that relies on the ServiceAccount identity of different Pods to group those Pods into different contexts.
